After suffering Omicron for 4 days, I'm back(actually yesterday im ok, but i played valorant that time:)  
R1 : Change the offline time of the ssh Active  
  vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config  
  find the ClientActive  
  remove the '#', the ClientActiveInterval means how many seconds the client send a purse signal to the server;  
  the ClientActiveCountMax describes how many purse signals server shouold receive before the server cut off the ssh connection.  
  After that, service sshd restart , and then reconnect to the server.

R2 : Add a ssh key to Github
  It cost me nearly 1 hour. I'm so fucking idiot. I'm idiot.
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "xxx@xxx.com"
  then paste the file \*.pub the public key to the Github settings.
  It works well.
