This is my first diary in Github. Up to now, my english writing sucks, and speaking even worse, maybe reading is my strong suit:{  
Q1 : when I type up arrow in a new user, it comes to fault like this:  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50364332/205663885-1ee60dfe-bb1f-477b-b01a-857fba4c1547.png)  
A1 : so this problem is caused by the default shell is not bash shell.  
  To solve this problem, just need to input  
            chsh -s /usr/bin/bash  
  it does not work, because it is now the unknowing "sh" (depends on the OS you use), so we type "bash" in this sh shell to change to bash shell, and type the above command again.  
  It works at my server.
