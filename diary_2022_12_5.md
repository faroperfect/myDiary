This is my first diary in Github. Up to now, my english writing sucks, and speaking even worse, maybe reading is my strong suit:{  
Q1 : when I type up arrow in a new user, it comes to fault like this:  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50364332/205663885-1ee60dfe-bb1f-477b-b01a-857fba4c1547.png)  
A1 : so this problem is caused by the default shell is not bash shell.  
  To solve this problem, just need to input  
            chsh -s /usr/bin/bash  
  it does not work, because it is now the unknowing "sh" (depends on the OS you use), so we type "bash" in this sh shell to change to bash shell, and type the above command again.  
  It works at my server.

Record 2 :  
  I think this license maybe the most private license. According to https://articles.opexflow.com/en/programming/github-license-choos.htm  
Record 3 :  
  I found a very good AI text generation website, https://opt.alpa.ai/  
  It can fullfill my sex fantacy when I wonder sth:P  
Q4 : When I tend to install a CSGO server. Error! App '740' state is 0x202 after update job.  
A4 : the issue is reported at here. https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/7843  
  It may can be solved by using this answer.

  But for no reason, it suddenly works.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50364332/205684400-bbb5ad12-8b7a-4094-a6e5-1cb262d32cfc.png)  
  And the csgo server need more than 31GB storage space and less than 41GB. I test it myself.
  About Q4 maybe I'm wrong, there was 2 problem, one is that disk have got no enough space, the other is the above question, maybe my answer mixed the 2. I'm lazy to tell the difference. I have solved my problem, and it's 0:14 now.
  I almost forgot to show the picture it works.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50364332/205687384-62fc3f5a-03f2-4e76-961a-f1227239472c.png)  
That's all.
