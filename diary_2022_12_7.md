R1 : Today i want to add some magic to my router, so i want to use ssh connect my router.  
  Do mention it!

  This should be no, so that u can easily access ur router. I found it by myself.  
  When I try to download the MAGIC, this happened

  Then I think i need to unzip the router firmware, add this "MAGIC" into the firmware, wrapped it up.
  But I find another way.

  reference website: https://askubuntu.com/questions/287021/how-to-fix-read-only-file-system-error-when-i-run-something-as-sudo-and-try-to  
  It works. Now I can make a new file.

  So do it again. But my thought is wrong, the question is the /usr/bin/ directory can not write.

  This time I found maybe the truth is that the armv7 software can not run on armv7l OS.

  This time it seems will work,

  But I think(reference to stackoverflow) maybe I need a bash rather than sh I use now.

  There is a busybox, what is the relationship and difference between a busybox and a bash, which version of bash should I install?  
  I don't know. So I turn to customize my own OPEN-WRT.  
That's all.
