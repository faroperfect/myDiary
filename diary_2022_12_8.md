To build openwrt, the doc says I need a Image builder.  
To install a Image builder, I need to install some pre-needed.  
Then I meet this,

It can be solved by install the specific version of exec.  
During this install, it will pop an warning,

I think it's normal, just to warn a downgrade operation.  
There is a very interesting thing while I download the image builder.  
The download link I copy from openwrt website is this below (I copied it from Ctrl+J the have downloaded history to ensure this is the true download link):  
https://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/21.02.5/targets/bcm53xx/generic/openwrt-imagebuilder-21.02.5-bcm53xx-generic.Linux-x86_64.tar.xz  
but when I change to VM, use VMware's menu's "paste", it become a different result.(below)  
when in terminal( I paste it to the terminal), it is this like : ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50364332/206233492-d42322b5-8bcd-4c14-8c73-2b2dc1f9e765.png)  
but i use paste on the VMware menu again, and paste it into the url input box of firefox browser in my VM, it turns to another wrong website. (watch the "generic") ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50364332/206233944-25c4d1ac-ede8-4201-84f5-41aa24296268.png)  
then i use paste on the VMware menu again, and paste it to another input box(google translate in the firefox browser in my VM), it becomes the right website it should be. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50364332/206234278-e4e45d84-74bf-4634-bb78-762b83fe2f10.png)  
So weird, isn't it?

That's all for the UI settings.  
Now there is some CLI settings.  
Can not import exchange string(map code)  
refer to this, I finally launch my headless server.
