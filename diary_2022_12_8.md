To build openwrt, the doc says I need a Image builder.  
To install a Image builder, I need to install some pre-needed.  
Then I meet this,

It can be solved by install the specific version of exec.  
During this install, it will pop an warning,

I think it's normal, just to warn a downgrade operation.  
There is a very interesting thing while I download the image builder.  
The download link I copy from openwrt website is this below:  
https://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/21.02.5/targets/bcm53xx/generic/openwrt-imagebuilder-21.02.5-bcm53xx-generic.Linux-x86_64.tar.xz  
but when I change to VM, use VMware's menu's "paste", it become a different result.(below)  
when in terminal( I paste it to the terminal), it is this like : ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50364332/206232829-a65c3b1f-cd86-4afd-a377-f8c4ee752721.png)  
but i copy from this terminal, and paste it into the url input box of firefox browser in my VM, it turns to the correct website that it should be. (watch the "generic") ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50364332/206231585-e96b2c1a-c48f-4f7f-a5fa-514a2d43828a.png)  
then i paste it to another input box(google translate in the firefox browser in my VM), it becomes wrong again. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50364332/206232085-df55ef93-5a96-404d-8afd-bf7e856b8115.png)  
So weird, isn't it?
